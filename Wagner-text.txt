The algorithm is AGE2 [1,2] and implemented in Java. AGE stands for approximation-guided evolution, and it uses a population to drive the exploration with the goal to achieve a good additive approximation of the true Pareto front. 
As the true Pareto front is not know a-priori, it makes use of an archive of all non-dominated solutions seen so far, which is an approximation of the true Pareto front by itself. AGE is a (mu+mu)-EMOA that assembles the population for the next generation (based on the union of current population and the offspring) as follows: it iteratively drops those solutions from a set of solutions that (if dropped) have the least impact on the union’s additive approximation of the archive. 

By setting the parameter epsilonGridWidth to values >0, an epsilon-grid approximation of the archive is used, which can reduce the computation time by orders of magnitude without affecting the final solution quality. As I am using post-hoc archive selection (e.g. as used in [3]), I use epsilonGridWidth=0 to deactivate the approximating archive, so that I can select the final population from the archive. For the selection, I re-use AGE’s own internal heuristic to select a good approximation of the archive. Note that, there are algorithms for problems with 2 and 3 objectives in the literature for an optimal subset selection (w.r.t. approximation), but not for this competition’s 5, 10, and 15 objectives. 

The algorithm is implemented in jMetal. The parameters are not tuned: SBX crossover (p=0.9, distribution index 20) and polynomial mutation (p=1/numberOfDecisionVariables, distribution index 20) are used.

Evaluation
- hypervolume  based on your HV.m, line 15: RefPoint = max(PF,[],1)*1.1;  my Hypervolume.java does in line 459: maximumValues[i] = maximumValues[i]*1.1;
- IGD: I use the fronts you provided in your jMetal code. 

Files
- the *.VAR files contain the decision variable values (space-separated)
- the *.FUN files contain the objective values (space-separated)
- the *.log files contain lines like the following: 
MaF08_5D BFNW 100000 mu:240 arc:12866 (HYPpop:0.08457447222778927,HYPpopCEC2018:0.1322195641803444,HYPreal:0.0,EPSpop:0.10599222125853902,SPREADpop:0.5819088376579361,IGDpop:5.526488596721899E-4,GDpop:6.578180067562868E-4) approximation(pop app arc):0.06115486426678762 
explanation: 
problem name 
BFNW (well, this should be AGE2) 
mu:240 (your limit, these are in the FUN/VAR files) 
arc: number of non-dominated solutions found (not written to file) 
HYPpop: hypervolume of the final population based on extreme points of the Pareto front 
HYPpopCEC2018: hyper volume of the final population based on extreme points (*1.1) of the Pareto front, which is why HYPpopCEC2018>HYPpop [you requested this]
HYPreal: ignore this
 EPSpop: epsilon approximation of the given Pareto front of the final population  
SPREADpop: spread of the given Pareto front of the final population 
 IGDpop: IGD of the given Pareto front of the final population [you requested this]
 GDpop: GD of the given Pareto front of the final population  
approximation(pop app arc): population approximation of the archive (this value is less than EPSpop, since only EPSpop knows of the given Pareto front, which is typically “mode detailed and bigger” than the archive)
